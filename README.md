# RPG Adventure
This is a role playing adventure game, where you are an adventurer who has to kill the demon king in the throne room. You have to level up, upgrade your weapons, sell resources and keep fighting monsters until you reach the demon king, and try your best to defeat him, with magic or brawn.
## What can you do?
There are checkpoints between each location, where we can buy upgrades for your weapons or magic, get health or magic potions. At the shop, you can also sell mob drops that you collect on your jounrey, You can also check your stats.

After this, however, is where the game really begins. When you select the hunt option, you go into a battle with a monster, with random attributes, like godly, weak, deadly, nimble, etc. With each of these attributes, the monsters attributes change accordingly.

## How do you fight?

To beat these monsters, you have a multitude of different spells, to take them down, along with physical attacks. If you're ever low on health or magic, you only have to take a health potion or mana potion, if you bought one in the store, at the cost of one turn.

The strength of your attacks increases exponentially when you upgrade it at the shop, but so does the price of the upgrades. You will need to fight demon kings and dragons on your way to save humanity, so make sure that you use your funds well!

## How do you win?

It's really simple, all you have to do to win, is beat anything that stands in your path, let it be an orc, a goblin, or a giant. Your main objective is to save humanity, but that only comes with beating everything that causes harm to humanity, the main threat being the demon king. Good luck!
